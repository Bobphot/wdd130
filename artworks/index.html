                <h1>CHOOSING HOW TO DISPLAY YOUR ARTWORK </h1>
                <p>Choosing artwork can be confusing, especially when there are a lot of choices available. Some of the questions we are asked are “How long will it last?” and “What kind of paper do you print on?” How do I hang it? We all try and envision what it would look like in our home. Since we are supplying artwork for a wide range of customers, we have different products available to make temple pictures affordable for all types of budgets. Whether you would like a large focal piece for a sitting room, or a small one that you hang by the mirror in the bathroom, we have solutions for you.</p>

                <h2>How long will my artwork last?</h2>
                <p>All of the artwork we sell on our website are considered archival, which means that the pigments used will last 50-100 years without fading. Of course, there are other factors that can reduce the life of your print. For example, where you display your artwork can have an affect on how long it will last. Will it be in direct sunlight half of the day? Is it in a place where it is exposed to chemicals or excessive humidity? These are some of the things to consider when you decide to buy art.</p>
