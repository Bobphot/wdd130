                <p>A modern look that has been very popular recently is our HD metal prints. </p>

                <h2>Metal, Acrylic, and other options</h2>
                <p>These are high gloss, vivid images that can be framed or ready-to hang on the wall without a frame. They are created by taking an image and fusing the inks into a specially treated surface. This is our personal favorite. Metal Prints come ready to hang. Depending on the size, they will either come with a rail on the back that you set on another piece that you hang on your wall, or with a wire hanger. This allows the artwork to sit off of the wall, or “float” about ¾” in front of the wall.  The corners are slightly rounded. This form of artwork is considered archival, meaning it will last and not fade over the years. </p>

                <h2>Acrylic Prints</h2>
                <p>Similar to metal, we have a new acrylic product. A photograph is created and then the image is sealed clear of acrylic. They sit off the wall about an 11/2”, and look very similar to the metal prints in vibrance and presentation.</p>

                <h2>Paper Prints</h2>
                <p>It is our goal to provide images in all price ranges, so whether you are shopping for a gift or are a student with a small budget, our paper prints are convenient and easy to use. They come in common frame sizes for those who would like to find their own frame for it. Sizes available are 8x10 to 24x36, although we understand people also will use them like posters around their house</p>
